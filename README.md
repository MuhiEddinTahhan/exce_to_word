# exce_to_word
this project was created based on a task given to me at work. The basic idea is to convert certain lines in Excel into a Word document that is easy to print and read.
# Upcoming Updates:
1- add a command-line interface where the user needs to put the info instead of hard coding the path and the lines.  
2- adding more features
